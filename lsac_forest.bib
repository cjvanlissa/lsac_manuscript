  abstract = {Structural equation model (SEM) trees are a data-driven tool for finding variables that predict group differences in SEM parameters. SEM trees build upon the decision tree paradigm by growing tree structures that divide a data set recursively into homogeneous subsets. In past research, SEM trees have been estimated predominantly with the R package semtree. The original algorithm in the semtree package selects split variables among covariates by calculating a likelihood ratio for each possible split of each covariate. Obtaining these likelihood ratios is computationally demanding. As a remedy, we propose to guide the construction of SEM trees by a family of score-based tests that have recently been popularized in psychometrics (Merkle, Fan, \& Zeileis, 2014; Merkle \& Zeileis, 2013). These score-based tests monitor fluctuations in the case-wise derivatives of the likelihood function to detect parameter differences between groups. Compared to the likelihood-ratio approach, score-based tests are computationally efficient because they do not require refitting the model for every possible split. In this paper, we introduce score-guided SEM trees, implement them in semtree, and evaluate their performance by means of a Monte Carlo simulation.},

Evidence consistent with the proposition that individuals differ in plasticity is reviewed. The authors document multiple instances in which (a) phenotypic temperamental characteristics, (b) endophenotypic attributes, and (c) specific genes function less like "vulnerability factors" and more like "plasticity factors," thereby rendering some individuals more malleable or susceptible than others to both negative and positive environmental influences. Discussion focuses upon limits of the evidence, statistical criteria for distinguishing differential susceptibility from diathesis stress, potential mechanisms of influence, and unknowns in the differential-susceptibility equation.},

  abstract = {Numerous theories and empirical studies have suggested that parents and their adolescent children reciprocally influence each other. As most studies have focused on group-level patterns, however, it remained unclear whether this was true for every family. To investigate potential heterogeneity in directionality, we applied a novel idiographic approach to examine the effects between parenting and adolescent well-being in each family separately. For 100~days, 159 Dutch adolescents (Mage\,=\,13.31, 62\% female) reported on affective well-being and four parenting dimensions. The family-specific effects of pre-registered (https://osf.io/7n2jx/) dynamic structural equation models indeed revealed that a reciprocal day-to-day association between parenting and adolescent affective well-being was present only in some families, with the proportion of families displaying a reciprocal association varying across the four parenting dimensions (11–55\%). In other families, either parenting predicted the adolescent’s affective well-being (8–43\%) or vice versa (10–27\%), or no day-to-day associations were found (16–60\%). Adolescents with higher trait levels of environmental sensitivity and neuroticism were more strongly affected by parenting. Thus, findings suggest that the ways in which parents and adolescents influence each other in everyday life are unique, stressing the need to move towards an idiographic parenting science.},

Studies on these so-called ‘within-family’ effects between parenting and adolescent adaptation are summarized in the current systematic review. Through a database and backward citation search, 46 eligible peer-reviewed studies were found, which were published between 2002 and 2018. The studies assessed a variety of parenting (i.e., support, control, negative interaction, time spent together, relationship quality, and differential parenting) and adaptation dimensions (i.e., externalizing and internalizing problems, affect, and interpersonal, academic, and physical functioning). Concerning the design of the studies, typical measurement intervals were either days (k\,=\,10) or 6~months or longer (k\,=\,30). Moreover, only six studies tested (and mostly found) heterogeneity in random slopes, and 20 studies used a moderation approach to explain heterogeneity. Of the concurrent associations, some (but not all) of the few available studies suggested that increases in parental control and support and decreases in negative interaction within a family were associated with decreases in externalizing and internalizing problems, as well as other indices of adolescent maladaptation. However, with respect to time-lagged associations, there is to date hardly any empirical evidence that parenting and adolescent adaptation predict each other within families. Based on the identified theoretical lacunas and empirical limitations, directions are provided for future within-family parenting studies.},

With respect to a hypothesized model of multivariate outcomes, such trees recursively find subgroups with similar patterns of observed data. SEM trees allow for the automatic selection of variables that predict differences across individuals in specific theoretical models, for instance, differences in latent factor profiles or developmental trajectories. However, SEM trees are unstable when small variations in the data can result in different trees. As a remedy, SEM forests, which are ensembles of SEM trees based on resamplings of the original dataset, provide increased stability. Because large forests are less suitable for visual inspection and interpretation, aggregate measures provide researchers with hints on how to improve their models: (a) variable importance is based on random permutations of the out-of-bag (OOB) samples of the individual trees and quantifies, for each variable, the average reduction of uncertainty about the model-predicted distribution; and (b) case proximity enables researchers to perform clustering and outlier detection. We provide an overview of SEM forests and illustrate their utility in the context of cross-sectional factor models of intelligence and episodic memory. We discuss benefits and limitations, and provide advice on how and when to use SEM trees and forests in future research.},

The bioecological model is an evolving theoretical system for the scientific study of human development over time. The model presented in this chapter represents major theoretical innovations from the 1983 chapter in both form and content. The new model is not a paradigm shift, but rather represents a transition from a focus on the environment to a focus on proximal processes as engines of development. We begin with the defining properties of the model, which involves four principal components (process, person, context, and time), and the dynamic, interactive relationships among them. We then turn to the research designs required for testing the model. In doing so, we not only present the next stage in the evolution of an ecological theory of human development, but we also document the requirements for conducting developmental research in the discovery mode. We conclude with a look to the future—and what the bioecological model means for the future development of our species.},

The principal and direct focus is not on analyzing the development of human beings as such, but on further developing the scientific tools that are required in order to improve the understanding of the conditions and processes that shape human development. Moreover, the primary interest is not in the forces that have shaped human development in the past, but in those that may already be operating to influence what human beings may become in the future. Yet, given that human evolution has been a slow process, the past and the present still provide the best clues to the future. As already documented in this article, human beings are now in a period of growing chaos in the lives not only of families but in all the day-to-day environments of people of all ages. Recreating social development is the principal challenge confronting contemporary societies in the 21st century. The necessary theoretical model is now in the making. The corresponding research designs are the next task. As for the need empirical findings, these still lie ahead.},

This revolution will be defined by the recognition that most treatment effects are heterogeneous, so the variation in effect estimates across studies that defines the replication crisis is to be expected as long as heterogeneous effects are studied without a systematic approach to sampling and moderation. When studied systematically, heterogeneity can be leveraged to build more complete theories of causal mechanism that could inform nuanced and dependable guidance to policymakers. We recommend investment in shared research infrastructure to make it feasible to study behavioural interventions in heterogeneous and generalizable samples, and suggest low-cost steps researchers can take immediately to avoid being misled by heterogeneity and begin to learn from it instead.},

  abstract = {Objective Experiencing depression in adolescence can disrupt important developmental processes, which can have longstanding effects on socioeconomic status and relationships. The objective of this article was to systematically review the evidence examining associations between adolescent depression and adult psychosocial outcomes. Method Five databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and ERIC) were searched for articles published from 1980 through March 2017. Eligible articles were peer reviewed, published in English, had prospective cohort study designs, and contrasted adult psychosocial outcomes in those with versus without adolescent depression. Outcomes with sufficient data were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses, with summary measures reported as odds ratios (ORs). A protocol for this review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42017059662). Results Of the 4,988 references screened for inclusion, 31 articles comprising 136 analyses were included for review. Twenty-four cohorts were represented. Seventy-seven analyses across 10 outcomes were meta-analyzed, with remaining analyses summarized narratively. Meta-analyses suggested that adolescent depression was associated with outcomes including, but not limited to, failure to complete secondary school (OR 1.76, 95\% CI 1.29–2.39), unemployment (OR 1.66, 95\% CI 1.29–2.14), and pregnancy/parenthood (OR 1.38, 95\% CI 1.06–1.81). Conclusion This review demonstrates that adolescent depression is associated with a myriad of adult psychosocial outcomes. Many are linked and can lead to the propagation of difficulties across the lifespan. These findings can have important implications for encouraging the provision of targeted mental health care early in development to improve life chances.},

This study aimed to assess the association between anxiety in adolescents and subsequent risk of suicidal behavior through a meta-analysis, offering crucial insights for suicide prevention. Methods Six bibliographic databases were comprehensively searched to clarify the association between adolescents anxiety and subsequent risk of suicidal behavior. We used a fixed-effects model to determine the total pooled effect size estimate and reported odds ratios and the corresponding 95~\% confidence intervals. Subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis and publication bias analysis were conducted with Stata version 15.1. Results The findings revealed a significant association between anxiety in adolescents and subsequent suicidal behavior (OR~=~2.33, 95~\% CI [2.00, 2.71]). Subgroup analyses indicated differences in mean effect size estimates based on clinical diagnoses and self-reported measures used to assess anxiety. The correlation strength between adolescent anxiety and subsequent suicidal behavior increased with a longer follow-up period. Furthermore, adolescents anxiety was associated with increased risk of subsequent suicidal ideation (OR~=~1.97, 95~\% CI [1.72, 2.25]) and attempts (OR~=~3.56, 95~\% CI [2.49, 5.07]). Finally, boys (OR~=~2.41, 95~\% CI [1.67, 3.47]) with anxiety had a greater risk of subsequent suicidal behavior than girls (OR~=~2.02, 95~\% CI [1.47, 2.78]). Conclusion This study revealed that adolescents anxiety increases the risk of suicidal behavior, including suicidal ideation and attempts. Consequently, there is a critical need for timely interventions tailored to adolescents with anxiety to prevent future instances of suicide.},

As a result, the lagged parameters that are obtained with the CLPM do not represent the actual within-person relationships over time, and this may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the presence, predominance, and sign of causal influences. In this article we present an alternative model that separates the within-person process from stable between-person differences through the inclusion of random intercepts, and we discuss how this model is related to existing structural equation models that include cross-lagged relationships. We derive the analytical relationship between the cross-lagged parameters from the CLPM and the alternative model, and use simulations to demonstrate the spurious results that may arise when using the CLPM to analyze data that include stable, trait-like individual differences. We also present a modeling strategy to avoid this pitfall and illustrate this using an empirical data set. The implications for both existing and future cross-lagged panel research are discussed.

  abstract = {Few people are as important for an adolescent's development as their parents. However, most research on parent–adolescent relationships describes long-term population-wide effects. Therefore, little is known about everyday interactions between adolescents and parents in individual families. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) measures families several times a day~as they go through daily life. This approach provides ecologically valid insights into which interactions took place and how they were experienced. State-of-the-art EMA studies suggest that within-family fluctuations in parenting may trigger changes in an adolescent's well-being and behaviors. In practice, moreover, EMA may strengthen family support and intervention research. This article reviews recent empirical work, highlights the (un)used theoretical and practical promise of EMA~and identifies key-challenges to unlock this full potential.},

This article focuses on the different imputation techniques available in the package. Four different imputation methods are currently implemented in VIM, namely hot-deck imputation, k-nearest neighbor imputation, regression imputation and iterative robust model-based imputation (Templ, Kowarik, and Filzmoser 2011). All of these methods are implemented in a flexible manner with many options for customization. Furthermore in this article practical examples are provided to highlight the use of the implemented methods on real-world applications. In addition, the graphical user interface of VIM has been re-implemented from scratch resulting in the package VIMGUI (Schopfhauser, Templ, Alfons, Kowarik, and Prantner 2016) to enable users without extensive R skills to access these imputation and visualization methods.},

  abstract = {Socialization scholars differ in how they view parenting processes: On one hand, scholars working from the perspective of the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) underscore the universally growth-promoting role of parenting that is perceived to support autonomy and the universal costs associated with parenting that is perceived as controlling. On the other hand, scholars adopting a more relativistic perspective focus on moderating factors (e.g., personality, culture) that may reduce or even cancel out the benefits of parents' support of autonomy and the costs of controlling parenting. In this article, we apply the principle of universalism without uniformity to this literature and review evidence for this principle. Specifically, we maintain that room for individual differences exists within SDT in children's appraisal of potentially autonomy-supportive and controlling parenting practices, and in the way they cope with controlling parenting. This perspective emphasizes children's active contribution in shaping the socialization process.},

Much like toddlerhood, it is often described as a period of vehement conflicts with parents, emotional upheaval, and irrational behavior. Such alarming portrayals of adolescence were common in early developmental research on adolescence, and they continue to remain prominent in contemporary popular scientific literature. The onset of puberty involves various physiological changes and physical changes that mark the beginning of adolescence as a chronological phase in human life. These biological changes come with a cascade of developmental changes, many of which have repercussions for parent–adolescent relationships. Illustrative of the systemic impact of puberty on family functioning is the way parents and adolescents discuss puberty-related changes and experiences. Some adolescents are open about these puberty-related events, disclosing freely the changes they encounter and relying on their parents for advice, information, and comfort.},

  abstract = {This 4-year, multi-informant longitudinal study (N = 480, initial age: 15) investigated the interplay between parental support, behavioral and psychological control, and adolescents’ emotion regulation development. We examined reciprocal effects between parents and children, mothers’ versus fathers’ unique roles in emotion regulation development, and sex differences. Multi-informant data allowed us to compare effects of adolescent-perceived and parent-reported parenting. Finally, innovative analyses allowed us to disentangle between-family differences from within-family predictive processes. Parenting and emotion regulation were associated at the between-family and within-family levels, especially according to adolescent reports. Support primarily played a role between mothers and adolescents, and perceived behavioral control between fathers and adolescents. Sex moderation revealed that support played a more prominent role in mother–daughter than mother–son relationships, and that daughters experienced greater behavioral control. Child effects outnumbered parent effects, which might reflect the increasing equality of adolescent–parent relationships. Finally, adolescent-perceived parenting was a stronger correlate of emotion regulation than parent-reports, suggesting that adolescents’ perceptions are a relevant source of information for research and practice. Consistent with the self-determination theory perspective on parenting, emotion regulation flourished when adolescents felt like mothers provided support, and fathers loosened behavioral control. These results are in line with the notion that mother–child relationships are supportive attachment relationships, whereas fathers provide “activation” relationships, challenging adolescents to regulate emotions autonomously by providing less explicit structure.

This study contributed to the existing literature by unraveling the temporal ordering of parental autonomy support and adolescent problem behavior. In addition, this study examined whether these linkages differed by parent’s sex, child sex, and reporter of autonomy support. Data of 497 adolescents (mean age at T1\,=\,13.03 years, percentage male\,=\,56.9) and their parents from six annual waves of the Dutch study Research on Adolescent Development And Relationships (RADAR) were used. The results showed that stable differences between families explained most linkages between autonomy support and problem behavior. Adolescents with fewer problem behaviors have fathers (both child- and parent-reported) and mothers (only child-reported) who are more autonomy supportive. The results did not differ between boys and girls. The findings suggest that prior studies may have overstated the existence of a causal effect of parental autonomy support on adolescent problem behavior.},
