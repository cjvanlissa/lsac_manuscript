# Method

The Workflow for Open Reproducible Code in Science (WORCS) was used to create a reproducible research archive [@vanlissaWORCSWorkflowOpen2020].
All analysis code, supplemental materials and synthetic data are available at <https://github.com/cjvanlissa/lsac_emotional_development>.
The original data and all study documentation are available under controlled access via <https://aifs.gov.au/growing-up-in-australia>.

## Participants and procedure

Participants were `r desc$n[which(desc$name == "Age")]` children and their `r desc$n[which(desc$name == "age_m")]` mothers and `r desc$n[which(desc$name == "age_f")]` fathers enrolled in the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children [LSAC, @australianinstituteoffamilystudiesGrowingAustralia2020].  repeated measures of parenting practices and child internalizing symptoms, separately reported for mothers and fathers. The analytic dataset excluded any identifier variables and recoded categorical variables for analysis consistency (e.g., recoding upper categories in extracurricular activities and child support to preserve ordinal structure).


## Measures

The primary predictors (hereafter: predictors) were parenting scales documented in @zubrickParentingMeasuresLongitudinal2014.
Both parents used five-point Likert scales (1 Never, 5: Always) to report their specific parenting practices, namely warmth (*Express affection by hugging, kissing and holding this child*), anger (*Of all the times you talk to this child about his/her behaviour, how often is this disapproval*), and inductive reasoning (*Explain to this child why he/she was being corrected*).^[Consistency and monitoring were considered as predictors, but omitted from this report due to poor fit.]

The primary outcome variable (hereafter: outcome) was Child Internalizing Symptoms, assessed on a three-point Likert scale (1: Not true, 3: Certainly true) using the child-reported emotional problems subscale of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire [SDQ, @goodmanPsychometricPropertiesStrengths2001], for example: *I am often unhappy, depressed or tearful*.

The predictors and outcomes were assessed biannually for four waves (except warmth, which was assessed for three waves).
We conducted confirmatory factor analyses (CFA), imposing configural- and metric invariance across waves and (for predictors) across parents, see Table \@ref(tab:tabinvar).
We considered RMSEA < .06, CFI > .95 and TLI > .95 to indicate good model fit [@huCutoffCriteriaFit1999].
We further computed composite reliability for each scale across respondents and timepoints [@greenReliabilitySummedItem2009].
For most scales, the fit of the metric invariance model was good, and reliability (assuming metric invariance) was acceptable, except for anger.

```{r tabinvar}
usethis::with_project(results_folder, {
  tab_invar <- read.csv("measurement_invariance.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
})

tab_invar <- tab_invar[, c("model", "items", "chisq", "df", "rmsea", "cfi", "tli",

tab_invar <- tab_invar[!tab_invar$model %in% c("con", "mon"), ]

tab_invar$model <- paste0(tab_invar$model, c(" C", " M"))
names(tab_invar) <- c("Model", "Items", "$\\chi^2$", "df", "RMSEA", "CFI", "TLI", "rel$_{min}$", "rel$_{max}$")

### Moderator Variables


```{r}
usethis::with_project(results_folder, {
scls <- read.csv("descriptives_scales.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
  interp <- read.csv("variable_interpretation.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
interp$name <- tolower(gsub(" .*$", "", interp$Variable))
desc <- merge(desc, interp, by = "name", all.x = TRUE)
desc$Person[is.na(desc$Person)] <- "NA"
desc$Resp <- factor(desc$Person, levels = c("NA", "Mother", "Father", "Father/Mother", "Not Applicable",  "Study Child", "Teacher/Carer", "Home"), labels = c("O", "M", "F", "M/F", "O", 
"C", "T/C", "NA"))
desc$unique <- desc$unique-1L
desc_cat <- desc
desc_cat$mode_prop <- desc_cat$mode/max_n
desc_cat$mode <- desc_cat$mode_value
desc_cat <- desc_cat[!desc$type == "numeric", c("name", "n", "unique", "mode", "mode_prop", "v", "Resp", "Question", "Values")
]

})

desc_num <- desc[desc$type == "numeric" & !desc$name %in% scls$model, c("name", "n", "unique", "mean", "sd", "min", "max", "skew", "kurt", "Resp")]
desc_scl <- desc[desc$name %in% scls$model, c("name", "n", "unique", "mean", "sd", "min", "max", "skew", "kurt", "Resp")]
names(scls)[2] <- "name"
desc_scl <- merge(desc_scl, scls, by = "name", all.x = TRUE)
desc_scl <- desc_scl[, c("name", "unique", "mean", "sd", "min", "max", "skew", 
"kurt", "Resp", "items", "cfi", "tli", "rmsea", "rel_lv")]
```

We included `r nrow(desc)` moderators (hereafter: moderators), ranging from demographic variables to environmental factors.
Single-indicator variables were included in the analysis without further preprocessing;
latent variable scores were used for multi-item scales (see [Supplementary Table S1](https://github.com/cjvanlissa/lsac_emotional_development/blob/a38bb8061a61e944f3f6c8e8532c9087084888ba/descriptives_scales.csv) for model fit and reliability).
Table \@ref(tab:tabcat) shows descriptive statistics for categorical variables, \@ref(tab:tabnum) for continuous variables,
and \@ref(tab:tabscal) for multi-item scales.

```{r tabcat}
knitr::kable(desc_cat[ , c("name", "n", "unique", "mode", "mode_prop", "v", "Resp")], caption = "Categorical moderator descriptive statistics. Unique: unique values, including missing. Mode: most common value. Mode_prop: proportion of cases with the mode value. V: categorical variable dispersion (similar to standard deviation for continuous variables). Resp: Respondent, M = mother, F = father, M/F = both, C = Child, O = other.",  digits = 2)
```

knitr::kable(desc_scl, caption = "Scale descriptive statistics. Resp: Respondent, M = mother, F = father, C = Child, O = other.",  digits = 2)
```

## Strategy of analyses

We set out to identify the most important moderators of the effects of parenting practices on children's internalizing symptoms (or: moderators of parenting effects).
All analyses were conducted in `r papaja::cite_r()`.
Missing data were imputed using 2-nearest neighbors [@kowarikImputationPackageVIM2016].
We used Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Models to estimate the parenting effects [RI-CLPM, @hamakerCritiqueCrosslaggedPanel2015].
RI-CLPMs are a longitudinal model that partition the repeated measurements of predictor- and outcome variables into two components: stable between-family differences in parenting and internalizing symptoms (random intercepts) and within-family deviations from this stable state.
We estimated separate RI-CLPMs for each parenting practice and parent.
All other parenting practices were included in the moderator set, to allow for interactions between parenting practices.
In an RI-CLPM, parenting effects can be interpreted as follows: If parents exibit higher levels of this parenting behavior than usual in one wave, does this predict a change in their children's internalizing symptoms in the next wave?

We used the machine learning method SEM-forests to identify potential moderators of parenting effects [@brandmaierTheoryguidedExplorationStructural2016].
A SEM-forest is comprised of several (in our case, 30) SEM-trees.
A SEM-tree is constructed by starting with the full sample, and identifying the moderator variable and its value which - when splitting the sample in two based on that variable and value - result in two post-split groups with the maximum possible difference in the value of a focal parameter as determined by a score-based test [@arnoldScoreGuidedStructuralEquation2021].
In our case, the focal parameter was the parenting effect's regression coefficient.
To illustrate: a SEM-tree might determine that splitting the sample into families who score above versus below a score of 1.72 on paternal anger results in two groups with maximally different values for the parenting effect's regression coefficient.
This splitting procedure is iteratively repeated for each of the post-split groups, and continues until a post-split group reaches a given minimum sample size (in our case: 200 cases).
Single trees are readily interpretable as a flowchart of binary branching decisions.
This interpretability comes at a cost of a loss of predictive performance; a single tree does not comprehensively explore all different ways in which differences in parenting effect might arise, or consider all moderators. 
It selects the best moderator to perform a split.
If several moderators are approximately equally good, or interchangeable, it only picks one.
Thus, a single tree illustrates one possible way in which differences in parenting effects might arise.

SEM forests capture greater nuance in the relationships between moderators and parenting effects by combining several trees that each explore the data in different ways.
This is achieved by bootstrapping the sample for each tree in the forest,
and by randomly selecting (in our case, 12) moderators to choose from at each split in the tree.
The analyses took approximately two weeks to complete on an Intel Xeon Gold 6130 2.10Ghz system and 32Gb of RAM.
The number of trees in the forest was set to 30 to allow for efficient paralellization across the system's 32 cores.

The primary outcome of interest was the relative importance of each moderator.
Importance is computed for each tree in the forest, by taking cases not included in that tree's bootstrap sample and using their values on the moderator values to traverse the tree until they reach a terminal node,
then computing the model fit (-2 log-likelihood) for those cases given the model in that terminal node.
Then, each moderator is permuted in turn, thus losing any meaningful information it contained,
and then the tree is traversed again using those now-meaningless moderator values.
Variable importance is defined as the decrease in model fit that occurs after permuting a moderator.
If a moderator was important, then the model fit should become worse when it is shuffled.

The second outcome of interest was the marginal association of moderators with the parenting effect,
which is obtained by sampling a grid of values along the moderator (in our case, 20),
and drawing a random sample (in our case, n = 1000) of participants to determine the values of all other moderators, to average out their effect.
Then, the expected value of the parenting effect is calculated for those combinations of values, and plotted.
Since our analysis yields 774 such plots, they are not reprinted here, but they are available in the [online repository](https://cjvanlissa.github.io/lsac_emotional_development/#shape-of-association).

The third outcome of interest is a single tree for each parenting practice.
This single tree tells a data story of the kinds of between-family differences that make a difference for the effect of parenting practices on emotional development - but importantly, this should be seen as just one possible way in which between-family differences in parenting effects might arise, not as the only possible way.

We focused on the interpretation of the top 10 most important moderators for each model.
While this cutoff is arbitrary, it is defensible to focus more on top predictors because variable importance declines exponentially; thus, moderators not included in the top 10 are much less important than those included in the top 10.
The single trees were also grown on the top 10 most important moderators.

## Results

Figure \@ref(fig:figvim) below show the permutation importance for each parenting behavior, for mothers and fathers separately.
The approximate shape of the marginal association is summarized by the shape of each point in these plots.
<!-- In the written description, we refer to specific variables by parent and number, e.g. the number one moderator of maternal warmth, father involvement, is M1.  -->

```{r figvim, fig.cap="Importance of the top 10 moderators for each parenting behavior. Point shape indicates the approximate shape of the relationship of each moderator with the parenting effect."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(results_folder, "vim_plot_paper.svg"))
```

#### Warmth

<!-- INVOLVEMENT IS REVERSE-CODED! -->
Note that many of the most important moderators for warmth were the same across mothers and fathers.
For both, the most important moderator was (lack of) *father involvement* (e.g., "In the past month how often did you eat an evening meal with this child", from "Once a day or more" to "Rarely"), which stood out above all other moderators for paternal warmth.
Despite being the most important moderator, the marginal relationship of father involvement with the effect of maternal- and paternal warmth was flat. A likely explanation is that its effect is expressed in interaction with other moderators.

```{r, figures-side, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", eval = FALSE}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(results_folder, "pdp_war_m_involvement_f.svg"))
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(results_folder, "pdp_war_f_involvement_f.svg"))
```

Mothers' and fathers' difficult life also ranked high for both ("How difficult do you feel your life is at present?", from	"No problems or stress" to "Very many problems and stresses"),
as did the related moderator, mothers' coping.
Child-reported family climate was also important for both maternal and paternal warmth ("How often do people in your family yell at each other?", from "Never" to "Always").
Finally, two adolescent characteristics ranked high for both:
children's (lack of) enjoyment of activity, which might be an indicator of children's good health ("How much do you enjoy being physically active?", from	"A lot" to "Not at all"),
and (lack of) school concerns ("Has the school contacted you because study child has behaved poorly?", from "Yes" to "No").

For maternal warmth, several micro-system characteristics were important, including whether the child had a *say* in what the family does, whether someone in the household *helped them with homework*, and whether the child was *biologically related to the parents*.

For paternal warmth, the child's persistent medical conditions (*sick*) ranked high,
as did two micro-level family characteristics: whether the child was of *indigenous* descent,
and whether they *had a parent living elsewhere*, which strongly related to the biological relationship to the parents ($r = .80$), and both might be indicators of being part of an intact biological family.

#### Anger

While there was less consistency in the moderators of parental anger, it is noticable that, across both parents, factors related to fathers were more important than those related to mothers.
